Notation:
There are two file that stores codes from my experiment on MNIST and CIFAR-10.
1. MNIST
AL_base_mnist.py:  containing the random sampling, entropy-based sampling, margin sampling, least-confidence sampling on MNIST.

...

2. CIFAR-10
AL_base_cifar10.py:  containing the random sampling, entropy-based sampling, margin sampling, least-confidence sampling on CIFAR10.
